Already tested on MAC OS X > 10.14. Uncertain for other versions of OS system, but should work.

### Denpendencies
1. you need to have **gtkmm-3 installed** before you can compile this project.

### How to make executable and run
1. Simply hit in the directory ```make```.
2. Run the excutable DijkstraDemo.

## Further development
1. More features might be added, but not promising.
2. Open for any ideas.
